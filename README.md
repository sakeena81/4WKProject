# 4 WEEK HTML/JS PROJECT

#### THE TASK AT HAND:... 
A 4 week project to create a HR application...

#### By _**Sakeena Ali**_

## What was the Challenge?
To create a HR application which contains employee information, which needed to capture the following data:

- Employee's NI Number
- Employee's Full Name
- Employee's Phone number
- Employee's Address
- Employee's Department
 (Note: we were not to use anybody's real information - dummy information is perfectly fine)
 
 (seemed straightforward enough... but then... we needed to meet the following 7ðŸ‘€ requirements)
 
1. The project must be written in PURE JavaScript 
2. All the employee information should be displayed on the screen
3. Users must be able to add an employee to the list 
4. Users must be able to edit employee information 
5. Users must be able to delete an employee 
6. Users must be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc. 
7. You must create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.

(I know what you're thinking... just seven?)

There was one aspect that stood out for me... *Be as **creative** as you'd like with the design of the application*

## How I expected the challenge to go.
Personally, four weeks of being highly caffeinated. Other than that, the requirements were not easy, however my mindset was to complete everything, by using what I had learnt from the training, we also had recordings of the class time with QA and my notes to refer back to. 

## What went well

The basic construct of the table was easy, and any HTML was straightforward as long as you keep to the basic principals there should be no issues. Furthermore creating the style sheet was the most enjoyable. I am very much a visual learner, and it was aesthetically pleasing to see how a item I have been working on looked less like a seventies text book diagram, mind you my 7 year old did choose the colours for the HR table, and it did look like a roll of 'parma violets'


## What didnt go as planned?

Where do i start?... 

firstly I had hardcoded the records into the table, visually it loomked more or less perfect, and my trainer was impressed...till he saw the code. So had to start that again. 
the second time round, I had managed to make what seemed to be a sata submission form for HR, but the code was mostly in HTML. 
## Possible improvements for future challenges

# 4WKProject

#### THE TASK AT HAND:... 
A 4 week project to create a HR application...

#### By _**Sakeena Ali**_

## What was the Challenge?
To create a HR application which contains employee information, which needed to capture the following data:

- Employee's NI Number
- Employee's Full Name
- Employee's Phone number
- Employee's Address
- Employee's Department
 (Note: we were not to use anybody's real information - dummy information is perfectly fine)
 
 (seemed straightforward enough... but then... we needed to meet the following 7 requirements ðŸ‘€)
 
1. The project must be written in PURE JavaScript 
2. All the employee information should be displayed on the screen
3. Users must be able to add an employee to the list 
4. Users must be able to edit employee information 
5. Users must be able to delete an employee 
6. Users must be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc. 
7. You must create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.

(I know what you're thinking... just seven?)

mind you there was one aspect that stood out for me... *Be as **creative** as you'd like with the design of the application*
